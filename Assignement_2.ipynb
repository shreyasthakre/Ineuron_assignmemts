    "\n",
    "3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate) ?\n",
    "\n",

    "6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "== is the equal to operator that compares two values and evaluates to a Boolean, while = is that assignment operator that stores a value in a variable.\n",

    "\n",

    "Ans: \n",
    "The Differences are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "The range(10) call range from 0 to 9 (but not include 10)\n",
    "The range (0,10) explicitly tells the loop to start at 0\n",
